## Introduction

Connecting to databases is a common task in software development. This project aims to simplify this process by providing clear, concise Python examples for various database systems. Each example is self-contained and focuses on the core connection logic.

## Project Structure

Each database example resides in its own subfolder within this repository. Every subfolder includes:

- A `README.md` file with specific instructions for that database example.
- A `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary Python packages for that example.
- A Python script (e.g., `connect.py`) that contains the code to establish a connection to the database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3 (version 3.6 or higher recommended)
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- Access to the database system you wish to connect to (e.g., a running instance of PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/greatbody/py-db-connections.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd py-db-connections
    ```

2.  **Navigate to an example folder:**
    Choose the subfolder for the database you are interested in.
    ```bash
    cd name-of-database-example # e.g., cd azure-sql-server
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    Using a virtual environment helps manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    Install the required Python packages for the specific example.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Follow the example-specific README:**
    Each example subfolder has its own `README.md` with detailed instructions on how to configure and run the connection script.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an example for a database not yet covered, or improvements to existing examples, please feel free to:
